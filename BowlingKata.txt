The game consists of 10 frames. A complete game is shown above.

A frame normally consists of 2 rolls (although may consist of 1 or 3, see below).

In each frame the player has two opportunities to knock down 10 pins.  The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries.  The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.  So in frame 2 above, the score is 10 plus a bonus of 2 (the value of the next roll.

A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try.  The bonus for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled. So in frame 4 above, the score is 10, plus a bonus of 3 (the value of the next two rolls).

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra balls to complete the frame.  However no more than three balls can be rolled in tenth frame.

PROBLEM:
We want a scoring class for a ten pin bowling alley.
A scoring object will be told the number of pins knocked down in each roll, when the roll happens.
When the game is over (all frames have been played), the object will be asked for the total score.

Develop the class using TDD.
Don't worry about writing code to drive the class, other than the tests.
